NetworkWordCount
================

Before running the scala app, run this command

nc -lk 9999

in a terminal window.

Then run the app with the run time arguments "localhost 9999"

As you type lines into the terminal window running netcat, you will see the output from wordcount on the screen.

Nifty.
